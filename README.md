# Visualizing the presidential vote in the cities with the most corruption cases in Colombia üó≥üá®üá¥

## Introduction
Corruption has positioned itself as the main problem that worries Colombians in the face of the election of the next president, according to the latest Invamer survey (June 10, 2022), it becomes the reflection of the importance and powerlessness to combat this scourge that takes away $50 billion Colombian pesos annually to the country, according to control entities.

This project attempts to answer the following question: What is the voting expectation in the cities with the most cases of corruption detected in Colombia?

In the elections for president in 2022, Colombians will be able to choose the candidate who, in their opinion, will tackle corruption in their regions and throughout the national territory. After the first round of elections, we can visualize the behavior of the electorate that yearns to completely eradicate this scourge, where according to the Corruption Perception Index ‚Äì 2021, (Transparency International) Colombia obtained 39 points out of 100, being 0, very high corruption and 100 absence of corruption. The country ranks 87th out of 180 countries evaluated. A score below 50 points indicates very serious levels of corruption in the public sector.

The degree of uncertainty that Colombians are experiencing regarding the country‚Äôs destiny can only be counteracted through the democratic exercise of voting, where reason and intellect should push us to review the anti-corruption plans in government programs.

We will conclude with an analysis at the end of the development, emphasizing the mix of the use of different tools to generate some valuable insights. All this without the slightest intention of biasing or taking political sides, since corruption is a cancer and it is in our hands to try to find a cure at the ballot box. It is also important to say that there is no correlation between the number of cases found and the winner of the elections in each region.

## DATA
The main data were downloaded from the report ‚ÄúAs√≠ se mueve la corrupci√≥n‚Äù, published by Transparencia por Colombia on December 2, 2021, where the analysis of 967 corruption facts reported in 2026 national press releases published between 2016 and 2020 was presented.

The report showed that the majority of corruption incidents (53%) are found in: Bogota (200 facts), Atl√°ntico (88 facts), Antioquia (76 facts), Santander (75 facts) and Valle del Cauca (74 facts), where the most frequent type of corruption is administrative corruption in the public sector.

Using the database of the latest bulletin of the results of Colombia‚Äôs first round presidential elections for 2022, issued by the Colombian National Registrar‚Äôs Office, we can make a comparison with the data from the corruption report to understand who voted for in each city to end this crime.

## Analysis and conclusions
Although cases of corruption were identified in all 32 departments and Bogot√° as the Capital District, it is important to highlight that 53% are concentrated in only five departments: Bogota, Atl√°ntico, Antioquia, Santander and Valle del Cauca.

With the 200 cases of corruption concentrated in Bogot√°, the fact of the centralization of institutions, public agencies and social and economic actors is highlighted, as well as the ease of reporting, since the report refers to the guarantees of freedom of expression and the existence of media outlets. The latter reflects the low level of reporting in some regions, not due to the non-existence of corruption cases, but to the lack of free exercise of investigative journalism, added to threats, terrorism and corruption itself.

The result of crossing the corruption data by department and the presidential election results in the first round simply translates into the confirmation of the trends towards the candidates that Colombians chose in each department. Gustavo Petro was the winner in Bogot√°, Atl√°ntico and Valle del Cauca, Federico Guti√©rrez won in Antioquia and Rodolfo Hern√°ndez in Santander.

Far from making a political analysis, there is a strong tendency towards a decisive change in the way Colombia is governed, a lot of polarization is generated towards the winners who will go to the second round on June 19, 2022: Gustavo Petro and Rodolfo Hernandez.

Many continue to call on NON VOTERS to actively participate in this decision by taking sides with arguments and knowledge of the proposals, not with memes or fake news. The indifference in abstentionism hurts more knowing that everything can improve if we agree to go towards the same goal and completely eradicating the corruption that hurts us so much as a people.

I found the way of data to tell visual stories, the learning curve is very steep, sometimes frustrating, running into problems all the time, I post and ask for help, sometimes it comes and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt, sometimes the solution is on Stack Overflow, sometimes on Youtube or in some tutorial on Medium, but I confess I love it and I would like to learn how to do it better.

I make this project 4 days before the presidential elections in the second round, all of us who have the opportunity to choose should do it. One vote makes the difference.
